class PNRDetector(BaseDetector):
    """Detects PNR (serial) codes (Passenger Record Number, usually present with train or flight bookings) in given text
     and tags them. Usually flight pnr codes are 5 to 8 characters long.

    Detects all PNR/serial codes of variable length about 5 to 20 characters in given text and replaces them by
    entity_name. Different detectors are used depending on the entity_name used to initialize the PNRDetector object.
    A task_dict, a dictonary mapping detector functions to entity_name is used for this.
    For example if 'train_pnr' is used to initialize PNRDetector(),
    _detect_railway_pnr() would be called to detect pnr codes. In case if entity_name is not present in
    task_dict , _detect_serial_pnr() is used to detect pnr codes.

    Attributes:
        text: string to extract entities from
        entity_name: string by which the detected pnr codes would be replaced with on calling detect_entity()
        tagged_text: string with pnr codes replaced with tag defined by entity name
        processed_text: string with pnr codes detected removed
        pnr_list: list of pnr codes detected
        original_pnr_text: list to store substrings of the text detected as pnr codes
        tag: entity_name prepended and appended with '__'
        task_dict : A dictonary mapping detector functions to entity_name. For example if 'train_pnr' is used to
                    initialize PNRDetector(), _detect_railway_pnr() would be called to detect pnr codes
                    In case if entity_name is not present in task_dict , _detect_serial_pnr() is used to detect pnr
                    codes

    For Example:
        text = "Your flight booking was sucessful. Your pnr is 4sgx3e."
        pnr_detector = PNRDetector("pnr_number")
        pnr_numbers, original_pnr_numbers = pnr_detector.detect_entity(text)
        pnr_detector.tagged_text

            Output:
               ' Your flight booking was sucessful. Your pnr is __pnr__number__. '

        pnr_numbers, original_pnr_numbers

            Output:
                (['4sgx3e'], ['4sgx3e'])

    Note:
        text and tagged_text will have a extra space prepended and appended after calling detect_entity(text)

    More Examples:

        text = "Your flight booking was sucessful. Your pnr is 43333."
        ...
        pnr_numbers, original_pnr_numbers
