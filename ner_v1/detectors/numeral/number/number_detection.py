    Note:
        text and tagged_text will have a extra space prepended and appended after calling detect_entity(text)

        and other any number. If we want detect number of people entity_name should be set to 'number_of_people'
        else any name can be passed as entity_name.
        We can detect numbers from 1 digit to 3 digit.
